TODO:

1. Be able to support multiple pairs of users.
    --> For example, two clients will be chatting 1 on 1, other two clients will be 
    chatting on their own one on one chat.
    --> This will be possible with just ONE server running.
2. Create a data structure to hold the pairs of clients who are chatting together.
    --> So, a client will enter a code number and the next client should enter the 
    same code number to be able to be connected to each other.
    --> After ending the chat, the code number will be freed.
    --> For now, it will only be done for 10 pairs (20 clients total)
3. Create a page on personal website for this program with screenshots and
    how the program works. This will basically be a page to show off what 
    this program is about.
4. Also, go through the program and try to find bugs and hen fix them.


Maybe:
    Eventually hard code the port number because one server can support multiple chats.
    But.. if that port number is busy, it will be bad. Unless, the server is running 24/7,
    which will not be the case.
