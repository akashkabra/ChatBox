TODO:

1. Be able to support multiple pairs of users.
    --> For example, two clients will be chatting 1 on 1, other two clients will be 
    chatting on their own one on one chat.
    --> This will be possible with just ONE server running.
2. Create a data structure to hold the pairs of clients who are chatting together.
    --> So, a client will enter a code number and the next client should enter the 
    same code number to be able to be connected to each other.
    --> After ending the chat, the code number will be freed.
    --> For now, it will only be done for 10 pairs (20 clients total)
